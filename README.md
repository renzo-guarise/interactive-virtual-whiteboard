# Interative virtual whiteboard
## Description
In this repository, an interactive virtual whiteboard was made with which it seeks to speed up learning in a virtual way. The project consists of a Python program that allows capturing video from the computer using the "OpenCV" library and a hardware device "the marker" made in the "Arduino" environment. This marking is captured by the artificial vision program, thus allowing interaction with a computer making notes, playing games, drawing, asking questions and answering, and so on. This project seeks to provide one more tool to make virtual teaching more enjoyable.

## How to use
```shell
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```
